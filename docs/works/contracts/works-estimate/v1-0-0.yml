  # All API's are POST. _create,_search,_update for post,get and put. RequestInfo will be part of body. For multiple records we can pass multiple value with comman seperated values*.
  # All _search will be synchronous and all _create and _update will be asynchronous*.
  # RequestInfo and ResponseInfo object should be reffered from Common*.
  # In _search API, tenantId should be passed in query param. In _create/_update, tenantId should be passed in the model.
  # Readonly means that even if these fields are passed in the request, it will be ignored in create/update and will not be added/updated in the entities. The readonly fields might be passed to the _search API's to make use of fields for the search Query API. while calling _search API's even mandatory fields might not be available, it is mandatory only in the _create API's*.
  # All errors will be returned with HTTP error code 400 with customized error code and messages. Consumer of the API need to handle 400 with customized error code and message.
  # Definition must start with Upper case followed by camel case.
  # Every model will have tenantId. Validate tenantId on create.
  # Parameter name must start with small case followed by camel case.

          Currently search parameters are only allowed as HTTP query params.
          
          In case multiple parameters are passed Abstract Estimate(s) will be searched as an AND combination of all the parameters.
          
          Maximum result size is restricted based on the maxlength of Abstract Estimate as defined in AbstractEstimateResponse model.

      summary: Create new Abstract Estimate(s).
      description: |
          To create new Abstract Estimate in the system. API supports bulk creation with max limit as defined in the Abstract Estimate Request. Please note that either whole batch succeeds or fails, there's no partial batch success. To create one Abstract Estimate, please pass array with one Abstract Estimate object.
          
          This API is used for creating Spillover (Ongoing works) and as well as new Abstract Estimates. All the flags like spillover, detailed estimate created, work order created and bills created flags will be allowed to select only in case of Spillover abstract estimate.
          
          The abstract estimate number and work identification numbers will be user entered in case of spillover work and auto generated in case of new work.
          
          Basic two steps workflow will be there for spillover Abstract Estimate and new Abstract Estimates will have multiple level workflow. The spillover Abstract Estimate can be created on approved status or with workflow based on configuration. The spillover work will have budget check which is required if Financial integration flag is turned on. Budget check not required If Financial integration flag is turned off.
          
          Asset details are mandatory if the Nature of work is 'Repairs or Addition'. If the Nature of work is 'New' then the Land details (Land and Estate module integration
          ) are mandatory based on the field value 'Land asset required'.
          
          There will be financial sanction during the workflow before Admin sanction. The financial details such as fund, function, budgethead, scheme, sub scheme, is fund available and fund sanction authority details will be captured during this stage. Whether budget appropriation required/not required during this stage is based on configuration.
          
          The final approver who does Administrative sanction will enter the Administrative sanction no. and Council sanction no./date in case of new Abstract Estimates. These details along with admin sanction date and authority will be captured during the initial create screen itself for spillover works.

Please note that either whole batch succeeds or fails, there's no partial batch success. To update one Abstract Estimate, please pass array with one Abstract Estimate object.
          
          Only the creator can edit all the fields when the Abstract Estimate in creator inbox(in Rejected status) or in drafts. Update during workflow will have all the fields readonly except few fields which are allowed to modify during each stage of workflow including Workflow Details. The status and workflow state will be updated during each stage of workflow approval.
          
          There will be financial sanction during the workflow before Admin sanction. The financial details such as fund, function, budgethead, scheme, sub scheme, is fund available and fund sanction authority details will be captured during this stage. Whether budget appropriation required/not required during this stage is based on configuration.
          
          Abstract Estimate date is not allowed to modify during workflow or during rejection except in drafts.  Abstract Estimate number not allowed to modify for normal estimate.
          
          The final approver who does Administrative sanction will enter the Administrative sanction no. and Council sanction no./date in case of new Abstract Estimates. These details along with admin sanction date and authority will be captured during the initial create screen itself for spillover works.

      summary: Create new Detailed Estimate(s).
      description: |
          To create new Detailed Estimate in the system. API supports bulk creation with max limit as defined in the Detailed Estimate Request. Please note that either whole batch succeeds or fails, there's no partial batch success. To create one Detailed Estimate, please pass array with one Detailed Estimate object.
          
          Detailed Estimate will be created for Approved Abstract Estimate or Detailed estimate itself can be created without Asbtract Estimate. This is one of the reason we are keeping most of the attributes in Detailed Estimate also which are there in Asbtract Estimate. The values for these attributes are auto populated from Abstract Estimate if the Detailed estimate is created for Abstract Estimate. All these values which are populated from Abstract Estimate should be readonly mode and user not allowed to modify these values.
          
          Basic two steps workflow will be there for spillover Detailed Estimate and new Detailed Estimates will have multiple level workflow. The spillover Detailed Estimate can be created on approved status or with workflow based on configuration. Technical Sanction will be part of the workflow for Normal detailed Estimate. Save as drafts required for Detailed Estimate. 
          
          Atleast one item is Schedule A(SOR or NON SOR) is mandatory before submitting the Detailed Estimate. Detailed Measurements needs to be captured for Detailed Estimate at each activity(SOR/Non SOR) level. It is not mandatory to capture Detailed measurements for each activity. If Detailed Measurements are captured then the Quantity at activity level will be defaulted from the computed value from measurements and not allowed to edit.
          
          Capturing of Location along with Latitude and Longitude from GIS Map needs to be mandated based on the configuration value.  
          
          If Asset already linked during Abstract Estimate creation then its auto populated from Abstract Estimate. Whether allowed to modify the asset linked in Abstract Estimate during Detailed Estimate creation is configration driven. Whether Asset linking mandatory or not also is based on configuration. The default value will be false.
          
          The Overheads and Estimate deductions selection is optional in Detailed Estimate. If its selected then the Total Estimate cost is inclusive of Overheads. The amount from Estimate deduction is not included in Total Estimate value.
          
          The sum of SOR and NON SOR value will be the total Work Value. Whether the Service Tax/VAT needs to be captured or not at activity level is based on configuration.

          Revision Estimate will be created for Detailed Estimate for which there exists a approved Letter of Acceptance/Work Order and Final Bill is not yet created for the same. Revision Estimate extends Detailed Estimate i.e., Revesion estimate is a sub set for Detailed Estimate. There can be multiple Revision Estimates for single Detailed Estimate. 
          
          Revision Estimate can either have Non Tendered Items(SOR Items which are not part of Original Estimate) or Lumpsum Items(NON SOR Items) or Change in Quantity of existing items(Additional or Reduced Quantity) or any of these combinations. Any of activity is mandatory to Submit Revision Estimate.
          
          Workflow might be there for Revision Estimate or it can be created in approved status based on configuration. Budget Appropriation for Revision Estimate should be mandated based on the configuration.
          
          Detailed Measurements needs to be captured for Revision Estimate which is similar to Detaield Estimate.
