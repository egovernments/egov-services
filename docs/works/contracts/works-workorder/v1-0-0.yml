  # All API's are POST. _create,_search,_update for post,get and put. RequestInfo will be part of body. For multiple records we can pass multiple value with comman seperated values*.
  # All _search will be synchronous and all _create and _update will be asynchronous*.
  # RequestInfo and ResponseInfo object should be reffered from Common*.
  # In _search API, tenantId should be passed in query param. In _create/_update, tenantId should be passed in the model.
  # Readonly means that even if these fields are passed in the request, it will be ignored in create/update and will not be added/updated in the entities. The readonly fields might be passed to the _search API's to make use of fields for the search Query API. while calling _search API's even mandatory fields might not be available, it is mandatory only in the _create API's*.
  # All errors will be returned with HTTP error code 400 with customized error code and messages. Consumer of the API need to handle 400 with customized error code and message.
  # Definition must start with Upper case followed by camel case.

      summary: Create new Letter Of Acceptance(s).
      description: |
          To create new Letter Of Acceptance in the system. API supports bulk creation with max limit as defined in the Letter Of Acceptance Request. Please note that either whole batch succeeds or fails, there's no partial batch success. To create one Letter Of Acceptance, please pass array with one Letter Of Acceptance object.
          
          Letter Of Acceptance can be created for approved detailed estimate after L1 Tender finalized offline status set to Detailed Estimate.
          
          The Schedule A (SOR and Non SOR) selected while creating the detailed estimate will be populated in LOA as bill of quantity(BOQ).
          
          The the LOA number and Agreement date will be user entered in case of spillover work and auto generated in case of new work.
          
          Basic two steps workflow will be there for spillover LOA and new LOA will have multiple level workflow. The spillover LOA can be created on approved status or with work. Whether the LOA is spillover or not is decided based on the flag workOrderCreated from Abstract/Detailed Estimate.
